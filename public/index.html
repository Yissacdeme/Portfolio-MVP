      <p>
        My love for organization and event planning served as inspiration for this endeavor.I've always loved giving people special experiences, so I decided to turn that enthusiasm into a digital solution. I had the concept for the Event Planner app when I recognized the need for an effective and user-friendly solution to assist people and businesses in smoothly planning and managing their events.
        The culmination of months of hard work and dedication is this project.

        This project, which is a component of my portfolio for Holberton School, highlights my web development abilities and expertise. It has been an amazing journey of learning, and I'm happy with how far I've come. There were several stages in the project timeline, from planning and design to execution and testing. I've had the chance to put the ideas I've learnt into practice and improve my problem-solving and teamwork abilities..
